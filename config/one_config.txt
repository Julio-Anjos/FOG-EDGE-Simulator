//Name of the platform files that will be created:
plat_name=one_config			//MUST BE FIRST PARAMETER

//Now lets define every msq_node and its group, please keep the ordering

//For the first msq_node:
msq_node_speed=1000000000 	//Execution speed in flops
num_sensors=2			//Number of sensors connected to this msq_node
sensors_speed=500000000	    //Execution speed in flops
connection_speed=30MBps		//Speed connection between sensors and msq_nodes (units can be found on the xml singrid documentation)
connection_latency=50us
burst_config=0				//What burst configuration it will use (look at the burst file)
