//Name of the platform files that will be created:
plat_name=test_plat			//MUST BE FIRST PARAMETER

//Now lets define every msq_node and its group, please keep the ordering

//For the first msq_node:
msq_node_speed=1000000000 	//Execution speed in flops
num_sensors=2				//Number of sensors connected to this msq_node
sensors_speed=500000000	    //Execution speed in flops
connection_speed=50MBps		//Speed connection between sensors and msq_nodes (units can be found on the xml singrid documentation)
burst_config=0				//What burst configuration it will use (look at the burst file)

//Next msq node:
msq_node_speed=1000000000  	
num_sensors=3				
sensors_speed=500000000	
connection_speed=50MBps
burst_config=0				

//Next msq node:
msq_node_speed=80000000 	
num_sensors=4				
sensors_speed=500000000
connection_speed=50MBps	
burst_config=0
