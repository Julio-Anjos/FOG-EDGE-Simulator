test_plat					//Name of the platform files that will be created MUST BE ON FIRST LINE

//Now lets define every msq_node and its group, please keep the ordering

//For the first msq_node:
msq_node_speed=1000000000 	//Execution speed in flops
stream_window_size=1000000	//Size in bytes, when this window fills up, the data will be send to be processed, unless warned by the processing unit that it cant. 
stream_buffer_size=1000000	//Size in bytes, the total buffer size, if the buffer fills up without the data being processed, the sensors are warned to stop sending data.
stream_timeout_time=20		//Amount of time in seconds before the data in the buffer is send to be processed even if the window size hasn't completly filled up.
num_sensors=1				//Number of sensors connected to this msq_node
sensors_speed=500000000	    //Execution speed in flops  (currently not used)
connection_speed=50MBps		//Speed connection between sensors and msq_nodes (units can be found on the xml singrid documentation)
connection_latency=5us		//Connection latency (units can be found on the xml singrid documentation)
burst_config=0				//What burst configuration it will use (look at the burst file)

//Next msq node:
msq_node_speed=1000000000  	
stream_window_size=1000000	
stream_buffer_size=1000000	
stream_timeout_time=20		
num_sensors=2				
sensors_speed=500000000	
connection_speed=50MBps
connection_latency=0us					
burst_config=0				

//Next msq node:
msq_node_speed=1000000000	
stream_window_size=1000000	
stream_buffer_size=1000000	
stream_timeout_time=20		
num_sensors=3
