stream_buffer_size=1000000	//Size in bytes, the total buffer size, if the buffer fills up without the data being processed, the sensors are warned to stop sending data.
stream_timeout_time=20		//Amount of time in seconds before the data in the buffer is send to be processed even if the window size hasn't completly filled up.
num_sensors=5				//Number of sensors connected to this msq_node
sensors_speed=500000000	    //Execution speed in flops  (currently not used)
connection_speed=50MBps		//Speed connection (link) between sensors and msq_nodes
