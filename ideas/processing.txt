#Ideas and problems with the processing of the data sent from sensors to msq nodes.
- Problem: Executing data on simgrid stops data transmission.
- Idea: Actors aren't actually hosts, so a new actor in the same host can be used for the processing of the data. (must do lots of code) Also, how to get the data from the msq to this new actor? (maybe need to refactor the whole code?)
- Problem: What exactly are we simulating, if not a simple execution of the received byte size? (BIG ONE MUST READ ARTICLES)
- Problem: Is the Kafka model special in some way i am not seeing?
