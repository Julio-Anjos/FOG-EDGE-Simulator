# Ideas and problems for simulating sensors:
- Idea: Pre-calculated list L of every time a package must be sent according to a math function, received together with the burst config. Make the sensors sleep_untill(L[i]) before sending new packages. (must do lots of code)
- Problem: Reading math expressions into code and then executing that expression must be somehow complicated, and might require additional libraries. (need to learn)
- Idea: Using https://github.com/cparse/cparse (currently testing)
- Problem: How to divide the packages between the sensors in a unequal manner? (not as important right now)
