We highly recommend you use the compile_run.sh to run your simulations, but if you want to manually make a platform, this is how you do it:

Command:

python createplats.py {path to platform config file}

Example:

python3 createplats.py ../config/plat_config.txt 


This creates a platform file and a deploy file that can be used to run your simulation, to learn how to make platform config file, look at the config/ file.
